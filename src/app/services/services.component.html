<marquee>Services marketing typically refers to both business to consumer (B2C) and business-to-business (B2B) services, and includes<br> marketing of services such as telecommunications services, financial services, all types of hospitality services, car rental services, air travel, health care services and professional services.</marquee>

<p>The service-goods continuum
Service-goods continuum

The division of consumables into services is a simplification: these are not discrete categories. Most business theorists see a continuum with pure service at one endpoint and pure commodity goods at the other. Most products fall between these two extremes. For example, a restaurant provides a physical good (prepared food), but also provides services in the form of ambience, the setting and clearing of the table, etc. Although some utilities, such as electricity and communications service providers, exclusively provide services, other utilities deliver physical goods, such as water utilities. For public sector contracting purposes in the European Union, electricity supply is actually defined as goods rather than services.[2]</p>

<marquee>Goods are normally structural and can be transferred in an instant while services are delivered over a period of time. <br>Goods can be returned while a service once delivered cannot.[3] Goods are not always tangible and may be virtual e.g. a book may be paper or electronic.

<p>Marketing theory makes use of the service-goods continuum as an important concept[4] which 'enables marketers to see the relative goods/services composition of total products'.[5]

In a narrower sense, service refers to quality of customer service: the measured appropriateness of assistance and support provided to a customer. This particular usage occurs frequently in retailing.[6]

Distinctions are made between goods and services in the context of international trade liberalization. For example, the World Trade Organization's General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) covers international trade in goods[7] and the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) covers the services sector.[8]
